# Data analysis

With **DIYABC Random Forest**, you can analyse synthetic or experimental genomic data, to infer parameters of population genomic model based on baysesian inference with ABC Random Forests (ABC-RF).

The DIYABC Random Forest procedure is divided into two phased corresponding to the two following modules: 

1. **training set simulation:** to specify how data will be generated in the ABC framework, in particular easily add various candidate scenarii and define related parameter priors for data simulation. 

2. **random forest analyses:** to guide users through the parameter inference and model choice methodologies, providing a simple interface for the supervised learning framework based on random forests (implementing the ABC-RF approach).
