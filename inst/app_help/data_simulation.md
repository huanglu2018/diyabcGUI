# Pseudo-observed dataset simulation

An **additional module** to simulate "pseudo-observed genomic datasets" (based on the DIYABC simulation engine) is also available. It can be used to easily generate synthetic "ground truth" data corresponding to a given historical scenario with given parameters, for instance for benchmarking purpose.
