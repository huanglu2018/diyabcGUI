# Simulation project

Files related to "pseudo-observed dataset simulations" will be stored in a 
sub-directory `project_name` under the folder `Directory`. This sub-directory 
will be created for new projects.

If the box `Timestamp directory` is checked, then a timestamp will be appended 
to the directory name `project_name`. This box is disabled when opening an 
existing project.

When you have chosen a project name and parent folder, you need to click 
on `Validate` to create the project directory before configuring it. If you 
want to change the project name or directory, you can click on `Reset` (and 
again on `Validate` afterward).

To copy the current project (you will then be able to choose a new name and 
directory), you can use the `Duplicate` button. When you are finished, you can 
close it with the button `Close`.
